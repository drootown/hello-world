# hello-world


I am active duty Air Force with 16 years in. I am married with two kids, 10 and 12 years of age. I graduated high school 24 years ago. I have three associate degrees with no bachelor's degree. I have been working on completing a bachelor's degree on and off throughout the years but have not completed it. I recently PCS'd into an assignment where I have the time to re-attacked this degree. My goal is to finish my degree before my young nephew gets his. This class is looking like it will be a fun one. Good luck to everyone!
